I'd like to take an interactive tutorial on building a personal website using Cursor and vibe coding.

Before you do anything technical, start by introducing yourself warmly. Don't create files, run commands, or take any actions yet. Have a short conversation with me first:

1. Tell me what we'll accomplish together (I'll have a real website by the end)
2. Ask my name and what I do
3. Ask what I'm hoping to get out of this session
4. Ask about my experience with Cursor and coding (so you can tailor the pace)
5. Let me pick a communication style: casual & friendly, professional & structured, or concise & to-the-point

Only after this conversation, move into teaching me about vibe coding and why context matters for AI — then set up the project. When it's time to download the lesson materials, you'll need to grab three small files from the internet (like downloading a PDF). Walk me through the permission prompt when it comes up — it'll be my first time approving something in Cursor. The files are at:
- Tutorial instructions: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcantaramar-tech/0to1VibeCodingPDPTutorial/main/TUTORIAL-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Design system: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcantaramar-tech/0to1VibeCodingPDPTutorial/main/tutorial-web-design-system.json
- Requirements template: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcantaramar-tech/0to1VibeCodingPDPTutorial/main/Technical%20Requirements%20Document%20-%20Template.md

Once files are saved, read TUTORIAL-INSTRUCTIONS.md and follow it step by step — picking up at Step 0.4 (you'll have already covered Steps 0.1–0.3 through our conversation and file setup).

Important:
- I'm not a developer. Go at my pace and explain everything in plain language.
- One question at a time. Wait for my answer before moving on.
- When introducing a concept or shortcut, make it practical — let me try it right away.
- Encourage me to use the microphone — it's faster and more natural.
- Always tell me what you're about to do and why before asking me to approve it.
- Let's go!
