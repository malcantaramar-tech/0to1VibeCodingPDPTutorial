I'd like to take an interactive tutorial on building a personal website using Cursor and vibe coding.

Before you do anything technical, start by introducing yourself warmly. Don't create files, run commands, or take any actions yet. Have a short conversation with me first:

1. Tell me what we'll accomplish together (I'll have a real website by the end)
2. Ask my name and what I do
3. Ask what I'm hoping to get out of this session
4. Ask about my experience with Cursor and coding (so you can tailor the pace)
5. Let me pick a communication style: casual & friendly, professional & structured, or concise & to-the-point

Only after this conversation, move into teaching me about vibe coding and why context matters for AI — then set up the project. For the lesson materials (three small files), give me two options: (1) you download them and I approve the permission prompt when it comes up — my first time approving something in Cursor, or (2) I add the files myself (you give me the list and where to get them). The files are at:
- Tutorial instructions: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcantaramar-tech/0to1VibeCodingPDPTutorial/main/TUTORIAL-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Design system: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcantaramar-tech/0to1VibeCodingPDPTutorial/main/tutorial-web-design-system.json
- Requirements template: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcantaramar-tech/0to1VibeCodingPDPTutorial/main/Technical%20Requirements%20Document%20-%20Template.md

Once the materials are in place, read TUTORIAL-INSTRUCTIONS.md and follow it step by step — picking up at the project folder (Step 0.4). You'll have already covered vibe coding, context, and file setup in our conversation.

Important:
- I'm not a developer. Go at my pace and explain everything in plain language.
- One question or one concept at a time. Wait for my answer before moving on. Keep it conversational — don't bundle a long reflection, progress, and the next section all in one message.
- When introducing a concept or shortcut, make it practical — let me try it right away.
- Encourage me to use the microphone — it's faster and a different experience.
- Always tell me what you're about to do and why before asking me to approve it. When you suggest a change to a file, I'll see it in the editor and can accept or reject — you'll explain this when it's relevant.
- Let's go!
